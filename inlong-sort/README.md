# Compile Multi-version of Flink
1. The packaging of different versions does not conflict with each other, and the dependent versions are managed by themselves.
2. The dependencies related to flink under the Sort module only need to introduce sort-flink-dependencies-xxx.
3. To switch the Flink version under the Sort module, you need to modify the relevant conflicts to ensure compatibility. Looking forward to your PR.
4. How to switch Flink versionï¼Ÿ
- By default, it will only pack: profile id is v1.13
- If you need to package all modules: mvn clean install -DskipTests -P v1.15,v1.13
